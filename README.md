# KiCAD Library Collection

This repository contains all symbols, footprints and 3d models I use with KiCAD. Some are manually created and some are autogenerated / converted from other format.


## How to use
Clone this repository to your computer and add those symbols and footprints you need. I personally use git for all KiCAD projects and therefore often include this repo as a git submodule within the projects source code.
```
$ git submodule add git@github.com:slimcdk/kicad-libraries.git
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Project configurations
### Environment variables
To include 3d models, configure the following environment variables in your project. `library` is the absolutte path to where this repository lives on your system.
```
SLIMC_3DMODELS=<library>/slimc/3d-packages
ESPRESSIF_3DMODELS=<library>/espressif-kicad-libraries/3d
```

I'm actively searching for a dynamic way to point to these directories.

## Update notifications

If you are like me and keep everything in git and automate everything, I can recommend dependabot to inform you about changes to this repository. Add this to `.github/dependabot.yml`

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "gitsubmodule"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
```




### Generated libraries
GitHub Actions will periodically regenerate / update the auto-generated libaries.
